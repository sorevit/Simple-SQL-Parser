SSP - A SIMPLE SQL PARSER in Ruby
----------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
SSP is a multipurpose SQL Parser written in Ruby using TreeTop.

The SQL parser is created from a LALR Context-Free Grammar, 
this grammar implementation is based on SQL-2003 (ISO/IEC 9075-2:2003)

ORGANIZATION
The grammar in SSP is organized as a hierarchy of productions,
and these are grouped by functional areas in SQL.
This grammar organization allows to manage partial reuse and
partial regeneration of SSP's parser to fit a given purpose within 
a given subset of SQL's grammar.

SSP PARSER GENERATION
The parser for SSP is generated using TreeTop PEG, this allows adding inline Ruby code as part
of the grammar definition to fit specific purposes.
Existing ruby code can be integrated by simply adding the needed method calls to your code
from the SSP (simplesqlparser.rb)
